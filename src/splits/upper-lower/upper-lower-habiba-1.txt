Terminology:
    Split: A split is a how to organize the workout through the week, the split we are using is an upper-lower split.
    Rep: A rep is a single execution of the movement.
    Rep Range: A rep range is the number of reps you do in a set.
    Set: A set is a group of reps done consecutively.
    Load: Load is the weight you lift in a set.
    Warmup: A warmup is a set of reps done at a lighter weight to get the muscles warm and ready for the working sets.
    Working set: A working set is a set of reps done at a heavier weight to stimulate muscle growth.
    Volume: Volume is the total number of sets done in a workout or training week.
    Frequency: Frequency is how many times a week you train a muscle.
    Failure: Failure is when you can no longer perform the movement.
    RIR/Reps in Reserve: RIR/Reps in Reserve is the number of reps you can do in a set until you reach failure.
    0-2 RIR: 0-2 RIR is when you can do 0-2 reps in a set until you reach failure.
    Progressive Overload: Progressive Overload is when you increase the weight or number of reps in an exercise.

Our training approach will follow a high intesity, high frequency approach, with 2x frequency per week focusing on progressive overload to measure progress.
After the acclimation period most excersis will be performed with high intensity heavy loads in the 4-8 rep range.

The focus is on getting used to the movements and the weight.
So we go with 1 warmup set and 2 working sets for each exercise.
Working sets are 10 reps with moderate weight.
